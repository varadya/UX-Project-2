# Project 2: Responsive Web Design 

## Overview
Most Design programs have websites. Eastern Washington University has *never* had one. It's time to change that. 

In this project, you will be creating a Responsive Website Design for EWU's VCD program. As always, it's up to you to uncover the details of the project.

## Process
### Getting Started
What is the goal of this site? Who is it for? Why is there a need for this site? Before you start to think about how it's going to look, you need to answer these questions. After that, everything you do for this project should be influenced by those answers. 

***Deliverable:*** Brief Write-up (3-4 sentences)

### Competitive Analysis
Who are our competitors and what are they doing? What makes them successful? What are we doing well? Perform a [SWOT Analysis](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm#) with your assigned group.  

***Deliverable:*** SWOT Analysis 

### Wireframes
The content of the site needs to organized in order to enable users to find information and complete tasks. In order to do this, you need to understand how the pieces of the site fit together to create the larger picture.

We are going to shift from prescriptive wireframes to a more content focused wireframe. Identify and list all of the content that will be on the page, and arrange it in a way that conveys hierarchy.

***Deliverables:*** [Content Outline Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hz81pJSg-SrS4e8UqamAHidGwstWk-lnbA2TwZtM-Ig/edit?usp=sharing) and Wireframe Prototype. You will need to create a duplicate copy on your personal account. 

### Style Tiles
This is *not a mood board*. Style Tiles are more defined. Consider typography, colors, UI style, etc... 

You will need to create two boards on [InVision](www.invisionapp.com) with different art direction. 

***Deliverable:*** Two InVision Board Links

### Design Prototype
Use Sketch to create your design files, and InVision to create your prototype. The structure should follow your wireframes, and the style should follow the selected Style Tile. ***Remix! REMIX! REMIX!!!***  

***Deliverables:*** Github Repository link to your project and Prototype links (Mobile and Desktop) 

### Medium Story
Take each deliverable above and create a case study of project 2. 

***Deliverable:*** Submit your Medium link on Canvas

## Requirements
Use the pre-defined Artboard sizes for responsive design in Sketch to create your layouts for the following sizes:
* Mobile (320px)
* Desktop HD (1440px)

While I don't expect you to write all of the content, I do expect you to write *some* of the content. Think about areas where *Lorem Ipsum* isn't going to be enough to convey what the content is.
